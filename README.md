# BizPal_HyperledgerFabric
Developing a one-stop-shop for business registration, permits and licenses, implemented using smart contracts.
Currently, the CMS provides information and documents for registration. The project plan includes integrating the backend with Government of Canada Federal and Provincial Nodes, complete approvals and creates immutable, secure, real-time registration record ledgers, which are deployed on the permissioned Hyperledger Fabric framework.

The various modules under design and development include:

Managed Services module - Whitelists private members into the permissioned network, which would include Municipalities, Provinces and Federal government nodes.
Ordering Service module - Creates a time-stamped signature for approved permits, licenses and registration applications
Smart Contract module - Creates a smart contract which automates and approves the user application basis provincial and federal rules, regulations and stipulations
Distributed Ledger Technology(DLT) - Records the approved registration records as real-time, secure and immutable single source of truth. Each node/block update would allow real-time updated view simultaneously to white-listed members of the permissioned network.Implementation using Hyperledger Fabric framework.
